# YogaIntelliJ - AI-Powered Yoga Pose Detection App

An intelligent yoga application that uses TensorFlow.js and MoveNet to detect and classify yoga poses in real-time through your webcam. Get instant feedback on your yoga practice with AI-powered pose recognition.

## 🧘 Features

- **Real-time Pose Detection**: Uses TensorFlow MoveNet model to detect body poses through webcam
- **Yoga Pose Classification**: Recognizes 8 different yoga poses:
  - Chair Pose
  - Cobra Pose
  - Downward Dog
  - Shoulder Stand
  - Triangle Pose
  - Tree Pose
  - Warrior Pose
  - No Pose (resting position)
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and intuitive React-based interface
- **Pose Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance for each yoga pose
- **Tutorials**: Learn proper form and technique
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get instant feedback on your pose accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** (v17.0.2) - UI framework
- **TensorFlow.js** (v3.10.0) - Machine learning in the browser
- **MoveNet** - Pose detection model
- **React Webcam** - Camera integration
- **React Router DOM** - Navigation

### Machine Learning
- **TensorFlow** - Model training
- **MoveNet Thunder** - Pre-trained pose detection model
- **Custom Classification Model** - Trained on 8 yoga poses
- **Python** - Model training and preprocessing

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Webcam
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Allow Camera Access**: When prompted, allow the browser to access your webcam

3. **Select a Pose**: Choose a yoga pose from the dropdown menu

4. **Follow Instructions**: Read the step-by-step instructions for the selected pose

5. **Start Practice**: Click "Start" to begin real-time pose detection

6. **Get Feedback**: The AI will analyze your pose and provide feedback

## 🏋️ Training Your Own Model

If you want to retrain the model with your own data:

1. Prepare your dataset in the `yoga_poses/train` and `yoga_poses/test` folders
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```
4. Copy the generated model files to the frontend
